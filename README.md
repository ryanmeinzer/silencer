# Silencer.ai

I built Silencer.ai to proactively mask noise pollution by fading white noise in and out through your phone's speakers adaptively based on its detected sound mapping memory from your phone's microphones.

## Use

Go to https://silencer.ai for the download link for either the iPhone or the Android app!

## Features

Start monitoring in the app to have it automatically detect sound that it will mask with pleasant white noise, faded in and out so that you won't even notice/awake. It memorizes such noises, so that it will proactively mask them in the future. Sleep like a baby. 👶🏻💤
