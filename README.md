# Silencer.ai 😴

Silencer.ai 😴 is an app that turns your phone into a smart white noise machine. It learns over time to keep your environment peaceful by using your phone’s microphone, memory and speakers to block unwanted noise.

## Technical Description

I built Silencer.ai to proactively mask noise pollution by fading white noise in and out through your phone's speakers adaptively based on its detected sound mapping memory from your phone's microphones.

## Use

Soon, you can go to http://silencer.ai for the download link for either the iPhone or the Android app!

## Features

Start the app to have it automatically detect unwanted noise, that it will mask with peaceful white noise, faded in and out so that you won't even notice/awake. It remembers recurring unwanted noise, to proactively block it in the future. Sleep like a baby. 👶🏻💤

## Future Features

Silencer.ai begins with noise masking, but ends with active noise cancellation for everyone's peace on this planet. Our evolving sound map dataset will enable us to serve users hyper locally through proactive software technology and communal efforts. Our active noise cancellation hardware + software tech will eliminate noise pollution altogether, without the crutch of white noise for masking.
