# Silencer.ai

Silencer.ai is an app that turns your phone into a smart white noise machine. It learns over time to keep your environment peaceful by using your phone‚Äôs microphone, memory and speakers to block unwanted noise.

## Technical Description

I built¬†Silencer.ai¬†to proactively mask noise pollution by fading white noise in and out through your phone's speakers adaptively based on its detected sound mapping memory from your phone's microphones.

## Use

## Features

Start monitoring in the app to have it automatically detect sound that it will mask with peaceful white noise, faded in and out so that you won't even notice/awake. It memorizes such noises, so that it will proactively mask them in the future. Sleep like a baby. üë∂üèªüí§

## Future Features

Silencer.ai begins with sound/noise masking, but ends with active noise cancellation for everyone's peace on this planet. Our evolving sound map will enable us to serve hyper locally through proactive technology and community efforts. Our active noise cancellation tech will eliminate noise pollution altogether, without the crutch of white noise for masking.
