# Silencer.ai

I built Silencer.ai to proactively mask noise pollution by fading white noise in and out through your phone's speakers adaptively based on its detected sound mapping memory from your phone's microphones.

## Use

Go to http://silencer.ai for the download link for either the iPhone or the Android app!

## Features

Start monitoring in the app to have it automatically detect sound that it will mask with peaceful white noise, faded in and out so that you won't even notice/awake. It memorizes such noises, so that it will proactively mask them in the future. Sleep like a baby. 👶🏻💤

## Future Features

Silencer.ai begins with sound/noise masking, but ends with active noise cancellation. Our evolving sound map will enable us to serve hyper locally through proactive technology and community efforts. Our active noise cancellation tech will eliminate noise pollution altogether, without the crutch of white noise for masking.
